## About

Augmented reality app build with Google AR SDK presenting car maintenance guides in an animated and interactive way. This application was an experiment. The functionality is pretty simple. You track horizontal surfaces and get the planes where you can attach an anchor of the 3D car object. Once you got the car anchored on the surface you can walk around it like its in your environment, watch guides for simple tasks like switching a tire or point your device on different car components and get a description of that component. 

> This app is not uploaded to the google playstore, so if you want to give it a try you can clone this repo and compile it using Unity.
